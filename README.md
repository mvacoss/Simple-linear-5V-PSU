# Simple-linear-5V-PSU
I've designed this simple linear PSU with LM7805
Without watermark, without useless names
It is double sided, but you can also export only single sided layout (B_Cu), so it is ideal for DIY etching

## Specs
- ~6V - ~10V IN
- +5V OUT
- MAX 1A (with suitable heatsink)
- Onboard LED indication (Lights up when the output is +5V)
